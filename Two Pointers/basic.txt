N,k         //maximum length of subarray having k 0's
arr[n]- 1,0,1,1,0,0,---------
 head=-1, tail =0    //starting condition

L<L'   =>2 pointers can be applied
R<=R'

while(tail<n){

    1)move head as far as possible   O(H) -checking and head++ only
    2) process the current window    O(A) - finding and updating the answer
    3) tail++, update accordingly    O(T)

Time complexity = O(N*(H+A+T))
